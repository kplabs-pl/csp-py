Introduction
------------

The Cubesat Space Protocol (CSP) is a small network-layer delivery protocol designed for use in space applications. It provides a lightweight and efficient way to handle communication between nodes in a network, making it ideal for use in resource-constrained environments such as small satellites and other space-based systems.

CSP supports various features including packet routing, addressing, and error detection, which are essential for reliable communication in space. It is designed to be simple and easy to implement, ensuring that it can be used in a wide range of applications.

The ``csp-py`` library is a native Python implementation of the Cubesat Space Protocol. It provides a set of classes and functions that facilitate the creation and management of CSP networks in Python. With ``csp-py``, developers can easily set up CSP nodes, manage interfaces, and handle packet routing and communication.
