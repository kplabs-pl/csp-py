    CSP
        The Cubesat Space Protocol (CSP) is a communication protocol designed for space applications, particularly in small satellite systems. It provides a lightweight and efficient means of communication between nodes in a network, allowing for reliable data transfer and routing.

    Node
        A basic unit of a CSP network, representing a device or system that can send and receive packets. Each node has a unique address and can communicate with other nodes in the network.

    Router
        A component in CSP.py responsible for managing the routing of packets between different nodes in a network. It handles the transmission and reception of packets, ensuring they reach their intended destination.
