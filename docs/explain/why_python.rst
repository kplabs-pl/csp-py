Why Python implementation?
==========================

Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose dynamic programming language that focuses on code readability and simplicity.
It is widely used in various fields, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. Here are some reasons why Python was chosen for the CSP native implementation:

1. **Readability**: Python's syntax is clear and readable, making it easier to write and maintain code. This is crucial for a complex protocol like CSP, where code clarity is essential for understanding and debugging.

2. **Simplicity**: Python's simplicity allows developers to focus on solving problems rather than dealing with complex syntax or boilerplate code. This is especially important for a project like CSP, where the goal is to implement a reliable and efficient communication protocol.

3. **Compatibility**: Python is a cross-platform language, meaning that the CSP implementation can run on different operating systems without modification. This ensures that the protocol can be used in various environments and scenarios.

4. **Community Support**: Python has a large and active community of developers who contribute to libraries, frameworks, and tools that can be used to enhance the CSP implementation. This support can help accelerate the development process and improve the quality of the final product.

5. **Extensibility**: Python's flexibility and extensibility allow developers to easily integrate third-party libraries and tools into the CSP implementation. This can help enhance the functionality and performance of the protocol without reinventing the wheel.
